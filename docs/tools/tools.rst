Anuket Thoth: The Tools
***********************

Model Selector
==============

This is an interactive tool to suggest the best model a researcher can start with to solve a problem in hand. The tools ask questions about the problem, the type and quantity of the dataset, the metrics preferences, understanding of the dataset. Based on the responses the tool will suggest the ML technique to start with. The techniques suggested are broadly categorised into three groups - Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement.

Data Extractor
==============

This tool, in phase-1, extracts monitoring data from Prometheus server. It takes the prometheus server IP, and the timestamp, and extracts CPU, Memory and Interface data from the server.
