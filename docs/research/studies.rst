ML Problems and Techniques for NFV
==================================

In this study, we provide list of all the published works on ML problems in NFV. The problems are categorised into - Correlation, Prediction, Anomaly Detection, Traffic Engineering, etc. This work also describes the methods/algorithms along with the dataset that is used to solve these problems. The inferences from the researcher is also added.


Opensource Projects for ML in NFV
=================================

In this work, we provide a list of opensource tools and frameworks that can be used to solve problems in NFV.
