# Introduction

AI has the potential in creating value in terms of enhanced workload availability and improved performance and efficiency for NFV use cases. This work aims to build machine-Learning models and Tools that can be used by Telcos (typically by the operations team in Telcos). Each of these models aims to solve a single problem within a particular category. For example, the first category we have chosen is Failure prediction, and we aim to create 6 models - failure prediction of VMs. Containers, Nodes,  Network-Links, Applications, and middleware services. This project also aims to define a set of data models for each of the decision-making problems, that will help both providers and consumers of the data to collaborate.
